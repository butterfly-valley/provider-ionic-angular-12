  "faq-faq": "<div> <h3>F.A.Q.</h3> </div> <div> <h3><b>What is BOOKanAPP.com?</b></h3> BOOKanAPP.com is an appointment booking portal where providers of different services publish (may choose not to) their schedules and make them publicly visible and available. Registered users may then book appointments of the advertised services digitally using slots marked as available in the providers' schedules.<br/><br/><h3><b> Can I have multiple schedules?</b></h3> Yes! You can have an individual schedule for each specialist your organisation has so the user can browse through all of them when visiting your page. This is specially usefull if you have medical clinic with several specialties and specialists.<br/><br/><h3><b>Can I book my own appointments for my customers?</b></h3> Yes! You can if you wish to. You can book an appointment for your customer which will be saved in the database and visible on the portal at any time.<br/><br/><h3><b>Can I print my appointments?</b></h3>Absolutely. You can choose a period you want to view your existing appointments for and save the list as a pdf file which you can print out as necessary.<br/><br/><h3><b>What if I do not want to disclose my schedule?</b></h3> You are free to do so if you choose to. You will have a tool to restrict web access to your page in which case you can choose to share a special link only with your trusted users and use the portal as the powerful schedule and calendar management it is.<br/><br/><h3><b>Is the portal free?</b></h3> The service providers have access to free or paid plans in accordance with their needs. The portal is free for the users and also free of any annoying advertising making it more attractive and professional looking.<br/><br/><h3><b>Can I register and try the portal for free?</b></h3>Yes! You can register and use it for using the available free plan.<br/><br/> <h3><b>Can I cancel my subscription?</b></h3>At any time. There is no commitment beyond the sum you have already paid so you may opt to cancel your subscription if need be.<br/><br/> <h3><b>Are the payment methods safe?</b></h3>You can pay through PayPal, via bank transfer or Multibanco or by credit card (through PayPal) and it is safe to say these are among the safest means of payment there are on the market.<br/><br/><h3><b>Other questions</b></h3> For any other question please do not hesitate to contact us by clicking on \"Contact Us\" link present on each page. </div>",

Ultimately, a dissatisfied customer and possibly a lost customer.",
  "about-us-2" : "With so many social networks and forms of communication, it is understandable that some information can be lost. We are constantly on the move to pay our bills at the end of the month. And the family? When was the last time you went to a cinema or park without having to touch your phone for professional reasons?",
  "about-us-3": "Not everything has to be so gray... We are also concerned with your health and well-being. Therefore, we decided you can also mix business with please. By joining our community, you can share your schedule with your existing customer base, as well as give visibility to your business to others, possible customers in the future, or simply have an electronic schedule you can access anywhere, as long as have internet access.",
